How to use console.
'Baudrate 115200'
1)Install teraterm for best experience.
2)Write 'help' on console and you can see all the commands which console supports and there instructions will also be written, about what each command does. 
3)There is debug command which can be used to see updated data for Co2 and PM sensor. It is also if you want to verify sensors are working properly

console navigation
1)'tab' moves cursor to the end of autocompleted command
2)'backspace' removes last typed character
3) Esc[A (key up) and Esc[B (key down) navigates through history


Basic Instructions
1)System will wakeup after set interval. interval can be checked from console
2)System will stay wakeup only for 20seconds in which 12seconds is dedicated for measurements(measurement time can reduced. In this time total 7 values of PM is taken and 3 values for co2,temp,humd).
3)During USB is plugged in system wont go to sleep and if system is in sleep and usb plugs in system will wakeup.
4)When USB is plugs in it takes about 13seconds to show mass storage, so during that time no measurement is taken as system focus on servicing USB, therefore
  measurements are taken after 50seconds(this time can be reduced, but I set it for safe keeping as on 20 30sec the measurement would start before USB is serviced and this causes problem in PM sensor)





Project file system

1)App_Main : includes main function that runs the logic
2)Embedded_CLI: console is processed here and all the functions related to it
3)Internal_RTC_Handling : system wakeup time and intervals are handled in this file including time and date setting
4)SDcard_Filehandling : This handles all the handling related to sdcard writing and reading making csv and json files
5)libs : This folder includes library files for sps30 and scdxx sensor, this folder also includes files for adc for reading battery voltage and utility file
